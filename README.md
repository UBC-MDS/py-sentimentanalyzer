# pysentimentanalyzer

This package performs sentiment analysis on the given texts and summarizes information from the text.

When a survey asks for written comments, it is often tedious to read through every response to extract useful information or just to get a quick summary.
By using this package, responses can be quickly summarized to get a general idea of the sentiments of the comments, which can be useful such as when a PR
team wants to know the overall sentiment on a company or when instructors want to know the overall sentiment on a course. The goal is to provide a quick
and easy summary that is easily interpretable through the use of visualizations.
